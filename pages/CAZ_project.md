## Investigating the effectiveness of the CAZ at improving air quality in Bristol

**Project description:** Bristol City Council introduced a clean air zone (CAZ), where certain types of vehicles were charged a daily fee to enter a specified area around the city centre, in November 2022 to attempt to meet government guidance on air quality.

In this project I investigate the success of this scheme in achieving these aims.

To quantify air quality, we examine the concentration of NO2 from momnitoring sites across Bristol in data made publicly available by Bristol City Council. As a guideline, government policy states that the annual mean concentration cannot legally exceed 40 Î¼g/m3.

### 1. Temporal trends in NO2 concentration

For this project, we examine two air quality datasets; one with data from 18 locations but spanning 1993 until present with high time resolution (continuous dataset), and one with yearly mean NO2 concentrations between 2010 and 2022 from 351 locations, collected using diffusion tubes (diffusion tubes dataset).

Firstly, we examine the decreasing long-term trend in NO2 concentration, and validate that the smaller subset of locations reflects the overall trend in NO2 levels:
