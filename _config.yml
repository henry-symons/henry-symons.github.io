  With a PhD and academic research positions in chemistry, I have an extensive background working with large and varied datasets and using advanced visualisations and statistical methods.
  <br><br>
  I am experienced in complex data analysis methods in Python, SQL and Tableau, and am now looking to apply myself in a data-focused role.
